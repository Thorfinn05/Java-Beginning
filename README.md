# Java-Beginning

Welcome to the **Java-Beginning** repository! This collection contains Java programs created during my 5th semester coursework. Each file demonstrates concepts and exercises relevant to learning Java, including classes, constructors, inheritance, encapsulation, and more.

## How to Use This Repository

- **Browse the `.java` files**: These contain the source code and are intended for learning and reference. Each file is named according to the concept or exercise it demonstrates.
- **Ignore the `.class` files**: These are compiled Java bytecode files generated automatically when you build or run the programs. They are not meant for direct reading or editing.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open any `.java` file in your favorite IDE or text editor to explore the code.
3. Compile and run the programs using a Java compiler (e.g., `javac Main.java` and `java Main`).

## Folder Structure

All Java source files are in the root directory. Each file covers a specific topic or concept from the 5th semester syllabus.
